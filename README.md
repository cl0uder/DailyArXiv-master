| **[Towards explainable decision support using hybrid neural models for logistic terminal automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07577v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled by the industrial Internet-of-Things.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that conclusions about these triggers are critically sensitive to model specification, moving beyond restrictive linear models with a flexible DML average partial effect causal machine learning framework. Our robust estimates identify the volatility of options-implied risk appetite and market liquidity as key causal drivers, relationships misrepresented or obscured by simpler models. These findings provide high-frequency empirical support for intermediary asset pricing theories. This causal analysis is enabled by a high-performance nowcasting model that accurately identifies capitulation events in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working Paper. 68 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables.

| **[Causal machine learning methods and use of cross-fitting in settings with high-dimensional confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15242v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observational epidemiological studies commonly seek to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Adjustment for potential confounding bias in modern studies is challenging due to the presence of high-dimensional confounding, which occurs when there are many confounders relative to sample size or complex relationships between continuous confounders and exposure and outcome. Doubly robust methods such as Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) have the potential to address these challenges, using data-adaptive approaches and cross-fitting, but despite recent advances limited evaluation and guidance are available on their implementation in realistic settings where high-dimensional confounding is present. Motivated by an early-life cohort study, we conducted an extensive simulation study to compare the relative performance of AIPW and TMLE using data-adaptive approaches for estimating the average causal effect (ACE). We evaluated the benefits of using cross-fitting with a varying number of folds, as well as the impact of using a reduced versus full (larger, more diverse) library in the Super Learner ensemble learning approach used for implementation. We found that AIPW and TMLE performed similarly in most cases for estimating the ACE, but TMLE was more stable. Cross-fitting improved the performance of both methods, but was more important for variance estimation and coverage than for point estimates, with the number of folds a less important consideration. Using a full Super Learner library was important to reduce bias and variance in complex scenarios typical of modern health research studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Machine Learning for Patient-Level Intraoperative Opioid Dose Prediction from Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09059v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the OPIAID algorithm, a novel approach for predicting and recommending personalized opioid dosages for individual patients. The algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Causal Machine Learning Requires Rigorous Synthetic Experiments for Broader Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08883v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful real-world use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[PC-SRGAN: Physically Consistent Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for General Transient Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06502v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super-Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional SR methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data is required to achieve performance similar to SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning by improving accuracy and efficiency, enhancing process understanding, and broadening applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code of PC-SRGAN and all experiments at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, combining the main content and the appendices, unlike having them separated in the published version at IEEE Xplore (https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2025.3596647)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-based Agents for Automated Confounder Discovery and Subgroup Analysis in Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07221v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who cuts emissions, who turns up the heat? causal machine learning estimates of energy efficiency interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04478v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity implications of domestic energy policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Variable Importance in Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13002v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal machine learning holds promise for estimating individual treatment effects from complex data. For successful real-world applications of machine learning methods, it is of paramount importance to obtain reliable insights into which variables drive heterogeneity in the response to treatment. We propose PermuCATE, an algorithm based on the Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) method, for statistically rigorous global variable importance assessment in the estimation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Theoretical analysis of the finite sample regime and empirical studies show that PermuCATE has lower variance than the Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) reference method and provides a reliable measure of variable importance. This property increases statistical power, which is crucial for causal inference in the limited-data regime common to biomedical applications. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of PermuCATE in simulated and real-world health datasets, including settings with up to hundreds of correlated variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimBank: from Simulation to Solution in Prescriptive Process Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14772v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Machine Learning in IoT-based Engineering Problems: A Tool Comparison in the Case of Household Energy Consumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12147v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be extended to other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **["Cause" is Mechanistic Narrative within Scientific Domains: An Ordinary Language Philosophical Critique of "Causal Machine Learning"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05844v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Learning has emerged as a major theme of research in statistics and machine learning in recent years, promising specific computational techniques to apply to datasets that reveal the true nature of cause and effect in a number of important domains. In this paper we consider the epistemology of recognizing true cause and effect phenomena. We apply the Ordinary Language method of engaging on the customary use of the word 'cause' to investigate valid semantics of reasoning about cause and effect. We recognize that the grammars of cause and effect are fundamentally distinct in form across scientific domains, yet they maintain a consistent and central function. This function can best be described as the mechanism underlying fundamental forces of influence as considered prominent in the respective scientific domain. We demarcate 1) physics and engineering as domains wherein mathematical models are sufficient to comprehensively describe causality, 2) biology as introducing challenges of emergence while providing opportunities for showing consistent mechanisms across scale, and 3) the social sciences as introducing grander difficulties for establishing models of low prediction error but providing, through Hermeneutics, the potential for findings that are still instrumentally useful to individuals. We posit that definitive causal claims regarding a given phenomenon (writ large) can only come through an agglomeration of consistent evidence across multiple domains. This presents important methodological questions as far as harmonizing between language games and emergence across scales. Given the role of epistemic hubris in the contemporary crisis of credibility in the sciences, exercising greater caution as far as communicating precision as to the real degree of certainty certain evidence provides for rich collections of open problems in optimizing integration of different findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating crop rotations around the world using satellite imagery and causal machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02384v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building sustainable food systems that are resilient to climate change will require improved agricultural management and policy. One common practice that is well-known to benefit crop yields is crop rotation, yet there remains limited understanding of how the benefits of crop rotation vary for different crop sequences and under different weather conditions. To address these gaps, we leverage crop type maps, satellite data, and causal machine learning to study how precrop effects on subsequent yields vary with cropping sequence choice and weather. Complementing and going beyond what is known from randomized field trials, we find that (i) for those farmers who do rotate, the most common precrop choices tend to be among the most beneficial, (ii) the effects of switching from a simple rotation (which alternates between two crops) to a more diverse rotation were typically small and sometimes even negative, (iii) precrop effects tended to be greater under rainier conditions, (iv) precrop effects were greater under warmer conditions for soybean yields but not for other crops, and (v) legume precrops conferred smaller benefits under warmer conditions. Our results and the methods we use can enable farmers and policy makers to identify which rotations will be most effective at improving crop yields in a changing climate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Data-Driven And Theory-Driven Modelling - Leveraging Causal Machine Learning for Integrative Modelling of Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09516v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical machine learning techniques often struggle with overfitting and unreliable predictions when exposed to novel conditions. Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing predictive robustness. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data center system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Neural System Dynamics: Combining Deep Learning with System Dynamics Modeling to Support Critical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14428v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this proposal is to bridge the gap between Deep Learning (DL) and System Dynamics (SD) by developing an interpretable neural system dynamics framework. While DL excels at learning complex models and making accurate predictions, it lacks interpretability and causal reliability. Traditional SD approaches, on the other hand, provide transparency and causal insights but are limited in scalability and require extensive domain knowledge. To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Neural System Dynamics pipeline, integrating Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. This framework combines the predictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models, resulting in both causal reliability and scalability. The efficacy of the proposed pipeline will be validated through real-world applications of the EU-funded AutoMoTIF project, which is focused on autonomous multimodal transportation systems. The long-term goal is to collect actionable insights that support the integration of explainability and safety in autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for publication in the Doctoral Consortium Proceedings of XAI 2025, The World Conference on Explainable Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

One common approach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step that ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top k within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary treatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued treatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize framework to allow for continuous treatments in uplift modeling. First, in the inference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from data using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization step, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a dose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP). This approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate treatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of adding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective function to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize utility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the trade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an adapted objective function. This showcases the framework's advantages and flexibility across diverse applications in healthcare, lending, and human resource management.

| **[Individualised Treatment Effects Estimation with Composite Treatments and Composite Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08282v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as \textit{composite treatments}, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as \textit{composite outcomes}, for a unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called \emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (double column), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[CAST: Time-Varying Treatment Effects with Application to Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06367v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment effects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based methods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring such as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal Analysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models treatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By combining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations of discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories. Using the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and individual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response, CAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up period, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are maximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care in HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions.

| **[Causal machine learning for high-dimensional mediation analysis using interventional effects mapped to a target trial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15834v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal mediation analysis examines causal pathways linking exposures to disease. The estimation of interventional effects, which are mediation estimands that overcome certain identifiability problems of natural effects, has been advanced through causal machine learning methods, particularly for high-dimensional mediators. Recently, it has been proposed interventional effects can be defined in each study by mapping to a target trial assessing specific hypothetical mediator interventions. This provides an appealing framework to directly address real-world research questions about the extent to which such interventions might mitigate an increased disease risk in the exposed. However, existing estimators for interventional effects mapped to a target trial rely on singly-robust parametric approaches, limiting their applicability in high-dimensional settings. Building upon recent developments in causal machine learning for interventional effects, we address this gap by developing causal machine learning estimators for three interventional effect estimands, defined by target trials assessing hypothetical interventions inducing distinct shifts in joint mediator distributions. These estimands are motivated by a case study within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, used for illustration, which assessed how intervening on high inflammatory burden and other non-inflammatory adverse metabolomic markers might mitigate the adverse causal effect of overweight or obesity on high blood pressure in adolescence. We develop one-step and (partial) targeted minimum loss-based estimators based on efficient influence functions of those estimands, demonstrating they are root-n consistent, efficient, and multiply robust under certain conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of missing outcome data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19711v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, missing outcome data can complicate treatment effect estimation, causing certain subgroups of the population to be poorly represented. In this work, we discuss this commonly overlooked problem and consider the impact that missing at random (MAR) outcome data has on causal machine learning estimators for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). We propose two de-biased machine learning estimators for the CATE, the mDR-learner and mEP-learner, which address the issue of under-representation by integrating inverse probability of censoring weights into the DR-learner and EP-learner respectively. We show that under reasonable conditions, these estimators are oracle efficient, and illustrate their favorable performance through simulated data settings, comparing them to existing CATE estimators, including comparison to estimators which use common missing data techniques. We present an example of their application using the GBSG2 trial, exploring treatment effect heterogeneity when comparing hormonal therapies to non-hormonal therapies among breast cancer patients post surgery, and offer guidance on the decisions a practitioner must make when implementing these estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Aleatoric Uncertainty of the Treatment Effect: A Novel Orthogonal Learner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03387v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal quantities from observational data is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. However, to make reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating averaged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect, but also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random variable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is necessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or quantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal machine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect at the covariate-conditional level, namely, the conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average causal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional assumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp bounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on the CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has several strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and, thus, quasi-oracle efficiency. Finally, we propose a fully-parametric deep learning instantiation of our AU-learner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Machine Learning for Moderation Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08290v3)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is valuable for any decision maker to know the impact of decisions (treatments) on average and for subgroups. The causal machine learning literature has recently provided tools for estimating group average treatment effects (GATE) to better describe treatment heterogeneity. This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting such differences in treatment effects between groups while accounting for variations in other covariates. We propose a new parameter, the balanced group average treatment effect (BGATE), which measures a GATE with a specific distribution of a priori-determined covariates. By taking the difference between two BGATEs, we can analyze heterogeneity more meaningfully than by comparing two GATEs, as we can separate the difference due to the different distributions of other variables and the difference due to the variable of interest. The main estimation strategy for this parameter is based on double/debiased machine learning for discrete treatments in an unconfoundedness setting, and the estimator is shown to be $\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under standard conditions. We propose two additional estimation strategies: automatic debiased machine learning and a specific reweighting procedure. Last, we demonstrate the usefulness of these parameters in a small-scale simulation study and in an empirical example.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliability remains largely unvalidated in empirical settings. In this study, we assessed the internal and external validity of 17 mainstream causal heterogeneity ML methods -- including metalearners, tree-based methods, and deep learning methods -- using data from two large randomized controlled trials: the International Stroke Trial (N=19,435) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (N=21,106). Our findings reveal that none of the ML methods reliably validated their performance, neither internal nor external, showing significant discrepancies between training and test data on the proposed evaluation metrics. The individualized treatment effects estimated from training data failed to generalize to the test data, even in the absence of distribution shifts. These results raise concerns about the current applicability of causal ML models in precision medicine, and highlight the need for more robust validation techniques to ensure generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages 1 Main table 2 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Using GPT-4 to guide causal machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18607v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its introduction to the public, ChatGPT has had an unprecedented impact. While some experts praised AI advancements and highlighted their potential risks, others have been critical about the accuracy and usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we are interested in the ability of LLMs to identify causal relationships. We focus on the well-established GPT-4 (Turbo) and evaluate its performance under the most restrictive conditions, by isolating its ability to infer causal relationships based solely on the variable labels without being given any other context by humans, demonstrating the minimum level of effectiveness one can expect when it is provided with label-only information. We show that questionnaire participants judge the GPT-4 graphs as the most accurate in the evaluated categories, closely followed by knowledge graphs constructed by domain experts, with causal Machine Learning (ML) far behind. We use these results to highlight the important limitation of causal ML, which often produces causal graphs that violate common sense, affecting trust in them. However, we show that pairing GPT-4 with causal ML overcomes this limitation, resulting in graphical structures learnt from real data that align more closely with those identified by domain experts, compared to structures learnt by causal ML alone. Overall, our findings suggest that despite GPT-4 not being explicitly designed to reason causally, it can still be a valuable tool for causal representation, as it improves the causal discovery process of causal ML algorithms that are designed to do just that.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nature versus nurture in galaxy formation: the effect of environment on star formation with causal machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02439v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is at the heart of modern astronomy. With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable progress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical processes behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far from known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the underlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal inference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of whether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal processes) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal effect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge techniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of disentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative and substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of $\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early universe, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star formation by a factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at higher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important role, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density environments by a factor of $\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a snapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to disentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii) stellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work may prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields that deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the Earth's climate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[From Text to Treatment Effects: A Meta-Learning Approach to Handling Text-Based Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15503v3)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the central goals of causal machine learning is the accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. In recent years, meta-learning has emerged as a flexible, model-agnostic paradigm for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) using any supervised model. This paper examines the performance of meta-learners when the confounding variables are expressed in text. Through synthetic data experiments, we show that learners using pre-trained text representations of confounders, in addition to tabular background variables, achieve improved CATE estimates compared to those relying solely on the tabular variables, particularly when sufficient data is available. However, due to the entangled nature of the text embeddings, these models do not fully match the performance of meta-learners with perfect confounder knowledge. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of pre-trained text representations for causal inference and open up interesting avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Causal Representation Learning</p></details> |

We consider 16 prediction tasks on tabular datasets covering applications in health, employment, education, social benefits, and politics. Each dataset comes with multiple domains, allowing us to test how well a model trained in one domain performs in another. For each prediction task, we select features that have a causal influence on the target of prediction. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that models trained on causal features generalize better across domains. Without exception, we find that predictors using all available features, regardless of causality, have better in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy than predictors using causal features. Moreover, even the absolute drop in accuracy from one domain to the other is no better for causal predictors than for models that use all features. In addition, we show that recent causal machine learning methods for domain generalization do not perform better in our evaluation than standard predictors trained on the set of causal features. Likewise, causal discovery algorithms either fail to run or select causal variables that perform no better than our selection. Extensive robustness checks confirm that our findings are stable under variable misclassification.</p></details> | <details><summary>118 p...</summary><p>118 pages, 55 figures, accepted at NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

A key benefit of causal ML is that it allows for estimating individualized treatment effects, so that clinical decision-making can be personalized to individual patient profiles. Causal ML can be used in combination with both clinical trial data and real-world data, such as clinical registries and electronic health records, but caution is needed to avoid biased or incorrect predictions. In this Perspective, we discuss the benefits of causal ML (relative to traditional statistical or ML approaches) and outline the key components and steps. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of causal ML and effective translation into the clinic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version; not Version of Record</p></details> |

Causal Machine Learning in Supply Chain Risk Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13556v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The penultimate goal for developing machine learning models in supply chain management is to make optimal interventions. However, most machine learning models identify correlations in data rather than inferring causation, making it difficult to systematically plan for better outcomes. In this article, we propose and evaluate the use of causal machine learning for developing supply chain risk intervention models, and demonstrate its use with a case study in supply chain risk management in the maritime engineering sector. Our findings highlight that causal machine learning enhances decision-making processes by identifying changes that can be achieved under different supply chain interventions, allowing "what-if" scenario planning. We therefore propose different machine learning developmental pathways for for predicting risk, and planning for interventions to minimise risk and outline key steps for supply chain researchers to explore causal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

However, it is challenging to understand the complex interactions among its biophysical, social, and economic components. Predictive machine learning (ML), with its capacity to learn from data, is leveraged in sustainable agriculture for applications like yield prediction and weather forecasting. Nevertheless, it cannot explain causal mechanisms and remains descriptive rather than prescriptive. To address this gap, we propose causal ML, which merges ML's data processing with causality's ability to reason about change. This facilitates quantifying intervention impacts for evidence-based decision-making and enhances predictive model robustness. We showcase causal ML through eight diverse applications that benefit stakeholders across the agri-food chain, including farmers, policymakers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |

Recent work highlights the importance of causal ML models in ADM systems, but implementing them in complex social environments poses significant challenges. Research on how these challenges impact the performance in specific downstream decision-making tasks is limited. Addressing this gap, we make use of a comprehensive real-world dataset of jobseekers to illustrate how the performance of a single CATE model can vary significantly across different decision-making scenarios and highlight the differential influence of challenges such as distribution shifts on predictions and allocations.</p></details> |  |

We consider a single production stage within a multistage, lot-based system that allows for optional rework steps. While the rework decision depends on an intermediate state of the lot and system, the final product inspection, and thus the assessment of the actual yield, is delayed until production is complete. Repair steps are applied uniformly to the lot, potentially improving some of the individual items while degrading others. The challenge is thus to balance potential yield improvement with the rework costs incurred. Given the inherently causal nature of this decision problem, we propose a causal model to estimate yield improvement. We apply methods from causal machine learning, in particular double/debiased machine learning (DML) techniques, to estimate conditional treatment effects from data and derive policies for rework decisions. We validate our decision model using real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a yield improvement of 2 - 3% during the color-conversion process of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Causal Machine Learning for Cost-Effective Allocation of Development Aid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16986v3)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations provide a blueprint of a better future by 'leaving no one behind', and, to achieve the SDGs by 2030, poor countries require immense volumes of development aid. In this paper, we develop a causal machine learning framework for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects of aid disbursements to inform effective aid allocation. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: (i) a balancing autoencoder that uses representation learning to embed high-dimensional country characteristics while addressing treatment selection bias; (ii) a counterfactual generator to compute counterfactual outcomes for varying aid volumes to address small sample-size settings; and (iii) an inference model that is used to predict heterogeneous treatment-response curves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data with official development aid earmarked to end HIV/AIDS in 105 countries, amounting to more than USD 5.2 billion. For this, we first show that our framework successfully computes heterogeneous treatment-response curves using semi-synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate our framework using real-world HIV data. Our framework points to large opportunities for a more effective aid allocation, suggesting that the total number of new HIV infections could be reduced by up to 3.3% (~50,000 cases) compared to the current allocation practice.</p></details> |  |

Our theory applies to nonparametric models, while naturally allowing for (semi-)parametric restrictions (such as partial linearity) when such assumptions are made. We show how simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables are sufficient to bound the magnitude of the bias, thus facilitating sensitivity analysis in otherwise complex, nonlinear models. Finally, we provide flexible and efficient statistical inference methods for the bounds, which can leverage modern machine learning algorithms for estimation. These results allow empirical researchers to perform sensitivity analyses in a flexible class of machine-learned causal models using very simple, and interpretable, tools. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two empirical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper was prepared for the NeurIPS-2021 Workshop "Causal Inference & Machine Learning: Why now?"; 55 pages; 10 figures</p></details> |

Notable breakthroughs include methods such as meta learners (arXiv:1706.03461v6) and heterogeneous doubly robust estimators (arXiv:2004.14497) introduced in the last five years. Despite these advancements, the field still faces challenges, particularly in managing tightly coupled systems where both the causal treatment variable and a confounding covariate must serve as key decision-making indicators. This scenario is common in applications of causal ML for marketing, such as marketing segmentation and incremental marketing uplift. In this work, we present our formally proven algorithm, iterative causal segmentation, to address this issue.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Bounds for Causal Regression: Insights, Guarantees and Sensitivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09516v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many algorithms have been recently proposed for causal machine learning. Yet, there is little to no theory on their quality, especially considering finite samples. In this work, we propose a theory based on generalization bounds that provides such guarantees. By introducing a novel change-of-measure inequality, we are able to tightly bound the model loss in terms of the deviation of the treatment propensities over the population, which we show can be empirically limited. Our theory is fully rigorous and holds even in the face of hidden confounding and violations of positivity. We demonstrate our bounds on semi-synthetic and real data, showcasing their remarkable tightness and practical utility.</p></details> |  |

This classical repeated sampling framework serves as a basis of routine experimental analyses conducted by today's scientists across disciplines. In this paper, we demonstrate that Neyman's methodology can also be used to experimentally evaluate the efficacy of individualized treatment rules (ITRs), which are derived by modern causal machine learning algorithms. In particular, we show how to account for additional uncertainty resulting from a training process based on cross-fitting. The primary advantage of Neyman's approach is that it can be applied to any ITR regardless of the properties of machine learning algorithms that are used to derive the ITR. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that for certain metrics, it is more efficient to conduct this ex-post experimental evaluation of an ITR than to conduct an ex-ante experimental evaluation that randomly assigns some units to the ITR. Our analysis demonstrates that Neyman's repeated sampling framework is as relevant for causal inference today as it has been since its inception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparency challenges in policy evaluation with causal machine learning -- improving usability and accountability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13240v2)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal machine learning tools are beginning to see use in real-world policy evaluation tasks to flexibly estimate treatment effects. One issue with these methods is that the machine learning models used are generally black boxes, i.e., there is no globally interpretable way to understand how a model makes estimates. This is a clear problem in policy evaluation applications, particularly in government, because it is difficult to understand whether such models are functioning in ways that are fair, based on the correct interpretation of evidence and transparent enough to allow for accountability if things go wrong. However, there has been little discussion of transparency problems in the causal machine learning literature and how these might be overcome. This paper explores why transparency issues are a problem for causal machine learning in public policy evaluation applications and considers ways these problems might be addressed through explainable AI tools and by simplifying models in line with interpretable AI principles. It then applies these ideas to a case-study using a causal forest model to estimate conditional average treatment effects for a hypothetical change in the school leaving age in Australia. It shows that existing tools for understanding black-box predictive models are poorly suited to causal machine learning and that simplifying the model to make it interpretable leads to an unacceptable increase in error (in this application). It concludes that new tools are needed to properly understand causal machine learning models and the algorithms that fit them.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

Investigating the causality between potential outcomes and treatment effects, where changes in pricing policies are the treatment, our analysis challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding incentive-based electricity pricing. The study's findings suggest that adopting such policies may inadvertently increase CO2 intensity. Additionally, we integrate a machine learning-based meta-algorithm, reflecting a contemporary statistical approach, to enhance the depth of our causal analysis. The study conducts a comparative analysis of learners X, T, S, and R to ascertain the optimal methods based on the defined question's specified goals and contextual nuances. This research contributes valuable insights to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable development practices, emphasizing the importance of considering unintended consequences in policy formulation.</p></details> |  |

We train a manipulator to autonomously study objects of which it has no prior knowledge, such as planetary rocks. This is achieved using causal machine learning in a simulated planetary environment. Here, the manipulator interacts with objects, and classifies them based on differing causal factors. These are parameters, such as mass or friction coefficient, that causally determine the outcomes of its interactions. Through reinforcement learning, the manipulator learns to interact in ways that reveal the underlying causal factors. We show that this method works even without any prior knowledge of the objects, or any previously-collected training data. We carry out the training in planetary exploration conditions, with realistic manipulator models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ASTRA 2023: 17th Symposium on Advanced Space Technologies in Robotics and Automation, 18-20 October 2023, Leiden, The Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Physical Activity on Quality of Life During Pregnancy: A Causal ML Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16909v1)** | 2024-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of Quality of Life (QoL) refers to a holistic measurement of an individual's well-being, incorporating psychological and social aspects. Pregnant women, especially those with obesity and stress, often experience lower QoL. Physical activity (PA) has shown the potential to enhance the QoL. However, pregnant women who are overweight and obese rarely meet the recommended level of PA. Studies have investigated the relationship between PA and QoL during pregnancy using correlation-based approaches. These methods aim to discover spurious correlations between variables rather than causal relationships. Besides, the existing methods mainly rely on physical activity parameters and neglect the use of different factors such as maternal (medical) history and context data, leading to biased estimates. Furthermore, the estimations lack an understanding of mediators and counterfactual scenarios that might affect them. In this paper, we investigate the causal relationship between being physically active (treatment variable) and the QoL (outcome) during pregnancy and postpartum. To estimate the causal effect, we develop a Causal Machine Learning method, integrating causal discovery and causal inference components. The data for our investigation is derived from a long-term wearable-based health monitoring study focusing on overweight and obese pregnant women. The machine learning (meta-learner) estimation technique is used to estimate the causal effect. Our result shows that performing adequate physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum improves the QoL by units of 7.3 and 3.4 on average in physical health and psychological domains, respectively. In the final step, four refutation analysis techniques are employed to validate our estimation.</p></details> |  |

Incorporation of causality into artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, however, is challenged with its vagueness, non-quantitiveness, computational inefficiency, etc. During the past 18 years, these challenges have been essentially resolved, with the establishment of a rigorous formalism of causality analysis initially motivated from atmospheric predictability.

This has been accomplished by introducing quantities which encode changes in the entropy of one variable when intervening on another. These measures, named causal entropy and causal information gain, aim to address limitations in existing information theoretical approaches for machine learning tasks where causality plays a crucial role. They have not yet been properly mathematically studied. Our research contributes to the formal understanding of the notions of causal entropy and causal information gain by establishing and analyzing fundamental properties of these concepts, including bounds and chain rules. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between causal entropy and stochastic interventions. We also propose definitions for causal conditional entropy and causal conditional information gain. Overall, this exploration paves the way for enhancing causal machine learning tasks through the study of recently-proposed information theoretic quantities grounded in considerations about causality.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the conference CLeaR (Causal Learning and Reasoning) 2024</p></details> |

While there is an extensive literature on tuning ML learners for prediction, there is only little guidance available on tuning ML learners for causal machine learning and how to select among different ML learners. In this paper, we empirically assess the relationship between the predictive performance of ML methods and the resulting causal estimation based on the Double Machine Learning (DML) approach by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). DML relies on estimating so-called nuisance parameters by treating them as supervised learning problems and using them as plug-in estimates to solve for the (causal) parameter. We conduct an extensive simulation study using data from the 2019 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference Data Challenge. We provide empirical insights on the role of hyperparameter tuning and other practical decisions for causal estimation with DML. First, we assess the importance of data splitting schemes for tuning ML learners within Double Machine Learning. Second, we investigate how the choice of ML methods and hyperparameters, including recent AutoML frameworks, impacts the estimation performance for a causal parameter of interest. Third, we assess to what extent the choice of a particular causal model, as characterized by incorporated parametric assumptions, can be based on predictive performance metrics.</p></details> |  |

In this context, accurate and dependable emergency responses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence of crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased due to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately estimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing essential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making. This paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the causal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal perspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on causal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal Model (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal effects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL) methods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and regression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on Highway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment effects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes cause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes, and the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the findings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while crash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours. Statistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched "counterfactual outcomes", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In particular, multi-domain datasets present a natural opportunity for showcasing the advantages of causal representation learning over standard unsupervised representation learning. While recent works have taken crucial steps towards learning causal representations, they often lack applicability to multi-domain datasets due to over-simplifying assumptions about the data; e.g. each domain comes from a different single-node perfect intervention. In this work, we relax these assumptions and capitalize on the following observation: there often exists a subset of latents whose certain distributional properties (e.g., support, variance) remain stable across domains; this property holds when, for example, each domain comes from a multi-node imperfect intervention. Leveraging this observation, we show that autoencoders that incorporate such invariances can provably identify the stable set of latents from the rest across different settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that determine when to stop an experiment early are typically applied to the data in aggregate and do not account for treatment effect heterogeneity.

We first establish that current methods often fail to stop experiments when the treatment harms a minority group of participants. We then use causal machine learning to develop CLASH, the first broadly-applicable method for heterogeneous early stopping. We demonstrate CLASH's performance on simulated and real data and show that it yields effective early stopping for both clinical trials and A/B tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 (spotlight)</p></details> |

These key features include best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied (but not necessarily consistently estimated) by predictive and causal machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, neural networks, random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods, both predictive and causal. Estimation and inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. We use quantile aggregation of the results across many potential splits, in particular taking medians of p-values and medians and other quantiles of confidence intervals. We show that quantile aggregation lowers estimation risks over a single split procedure, and establish its principal inferential properties. Finally, our analysis reveals ways to build provably better machine learning proxies through causal learning: we can use the objective functions that we develop to construct the best linear predictors of the effects, to obtain better machine learning proxies in the initial step. We illustrate the use of both inferential tools and causal learners with a randomized field experiment that evaluates a combination of nudges to stimulate demand for immunization in India.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages, 8 figures, 17 tables, includes Online Appendix, minor revision with respect to previous version</p></details> |

When combined with large-scale perturbation screens, through which specific biological mechanisms can be targeted, these technologies allow for measuring the effect of targeted perturbations on the whole transcriptome. These advances provide an opportunity to better understand the causative role of genes in complex biological processes such as gene regulation, disease progression or cellular development. However, the high-dimensional nature of the data, coupled with the intricate complexity of biological systems renders this task nontrivial. Within the machine learning community, there has been a recent increase of interest in causality, with a focus on adapting established causal techniques and algorithms to handle high-dimensional data. In this perspective, we delineate the application of these methodologies within the realm of single-cell genomics and their challenges. We first present the model that underlies most of current causal approaches to single-cell biology and discuss and challenge the assumptions it entails from the biological point of view. We then identify open problems in the application of causal approaches to single-cell data: generalising to unseen environments, learning interpretable models, and learning causal models of dynamics. For each problem, we discuss how various research directions - including the development of computational approaches and the adaptation of experimental protocols - may offer ways forward, or on the contrary pose some difficulties. With the advent of single cell atlases and increasing perturbation data, we expect causal models to become a crucial tool for informed experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, 1 box</p></details> |
| **[Policy learning for many outcomes of interest: Combining optimal policy trees with multi-objective Bayesian optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06312v2)** | 2023-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for learning optimal policies use causal machine learning models to create human-interpretable rules for making choices around the allocation of different policy interventions. However, in realistic policy-making contexts, decision-makers often care about trade-offs between outcomes, not just single-mindedly maximising utility for one outcome. This paper proposes an approach termed Multi-Objective Policy Learning (MOPoL) which combines optimal decision trees for policy learning with a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation approach to explore the trade-off between multiple outcomes. It does this by building a Pareto frontier of non-dominated models for different hyperparameter settings which govern outcome weighting. The key here is that a low-cost greedy tree can be an accurate proxy for the very computationally costly optimal tree for the purposes of making decisions which means models can be repeatedly fit to learn a Pareto frontier. The method is applied to a real-world case-study of non-price rationing of anti-malarial medication in Kenya.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Loan Pricing: Investigating the Impacts of Selection Bias on Identifying Bid-Response Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03730v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lending, where prices are specific to both customers and products, having a well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential to effective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived from observational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of ``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature, the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not. We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing pricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the reaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we simulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on mortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of parametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual bid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such as logistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias. In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learning and show their capability to overcome selection bias in pricing data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

The causal representation praovided by these algorithms enables transparency and explainability, which is necessary for decision making in critical real-world problems. Yet, causal ML has had limited impact in practice compared to associational ML. This paper investigates the challenges of causal ML with application to COVID-19 UK pandemic data. We collate data from various public sources and investigate what the various structure learning algorithms learn from these data. We explore the impact of different data formats on algorithms spanning different classes of learning, and assess the results produced by each algorithm, and groups of algorithms, in terms of graphical structure, model dimensionality, sensitivity analysis, confounding variables, predictive and interventional inference. We use these results to highlight open problems in causal structure learning and directions for future research. To facilitate future work, we make all graphs, models, data sets, and source code publicly available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness Implications of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation with Machine Learning Methods in Policy-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00805v1)** | 2023-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal machine learning methods which flexibly generate heterogeneous treatment effect estimates could be very useful tools for governments trying to make and implement policy. However, as the critical artificial intelligence literature has shown, governments must be very careful of unintended consequences when using machine learning models. One way to try and protect against unintended bad outcomes is with AI Fairness methods which seek to create machine learning models where sensitive variables like race or gender do not influence outcomes. In this paper we argue that standard AI Fairness approaches developed for predictive machine learning are not suitable for all causal machine learning applications because causal machine learning generally (at least so far) uses modelling to inform a human who is the ultimate decision-maker while AI Fairness approaches assume a model that is making decisions directly. We define these scenarios as indirect and direct decision-making respectively and suggest that policy-making is best seen as a joint decision where the causal machine learning model usually only has indirect power. We lay out a definition of fairness for this scenario - a model that provides the information a decision-maker needs to accurately make a value judgement about just policy outcomes - and argue that the complexity of causal machine learning models can make this difficult to achieve. The solution here is not traditional AI Fairness adjustments, but careful modelling and awareness of some of the decision-making biases that these methods might encourage which we describe.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

However, the effects of such practices are known to depend on environmental conditions, and are therefore expected to change as a result of a changing climate. We study the impact of crop diversification on productivity in the context of climate change. We leverage heterogeneous Earth Observation data and contribute a data-driven approach based on causal machine learning for understanding how crop diversification impacts may change in the future. We apply this method to the country of Cyprus throughout a 4-year period. We find that, on average, crop diversification significantly benefited the net primary productivity of crops, increasing it by 2.8%. The effect generally synergized well with higher maximum temperatures and lower soil moistures. In a warmer and more drought-prone climate, we conclude that crop diversification exhibits promising adaptation potential and is thus a sensible policy choice with regards to agricultural productivity for present and future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at ISPRS Geospatial Week 2023</p></details> |
| **[Causally Learning an Optimal Rework Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04223v1)** | 2023-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In manufacturing, rework refers to an optional step of a production process which aims to eliminate errors or remedy products that do not meet the desired quality standards. Reworking a production lot involves repeating a previous production stage with adjustments to ensure that the final product meets the required specifications. While offering the chance to improve the yield and thus increase the revenue of a production lot, a rework step also incurs additional costs. Additionally, the rework of parts that already meet the target specifications may damage them and decrease the yield. In this paper, we apply double/debiased machine learning (DML) to estimate the conditional treatment effect of a rework step during the color conversion process in opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing on the final product yield. We utilize the implementation DoubleML to develop policies for the rework of components and estimate their value empirically. From our causal machine learning analysis we derive implications for the coating of monochromatic LEDs with conversion layers.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

Prior work has demonstrated that adversarial perturbations of completely observed training data may be used to force the learning of inaccurate causal structural models (SCMs). However, when the data can be audited for correctness (e.g., it is crytographically signed by its source), this adversarial mechanism is invalidated. This work introduces a novel attack methodology wherein the adversary deceptively omits a portion of the true training data to bias the learned causal structures in a desired manner. Theoretically sound attack mechanisms are derived for the case of arbitrary SCMs, and a sample-efficient learning-based heuristic is given for Gaussian SCMs. Experimental validation of these approaches on real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial missingness attacks at deceiving popular causal structure learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We find meaningful heterogeneous impacts of Medicaid on ED use using causal machine learning methods. The individualized treatment effect distribution includes a wide range of negative and positive values, suggesting the average effect masks substantial heterogeneity. A small group-about 14% of participants-in the right tail of the distribution drives the overall effect. We identify priority groups with economically significant increases in ED usage based on demographics and previous utilization. Intensive margin effects are an important driver of increases in ED utilization.</p></details> |  |

The process involves isolating root causes, defining and implementing appropriate treatments, and refining treatments if needed. The main pain-point is the lack of a systematic method to identify causal relationships, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and direct the next actionable treatment if the current treatment was deemed ineffective. This paper will show how we leverage causal Machine Learning (ML) to speed up such processes. A real-word data set collected from on-road vehicles will be used to demonstrate the proposed framework.

A causal machine learning evaluation of training in Belgium](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12864v4)** | 2022-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on administrative data of unemployed in Belgium, we estimate the labour market effects of three training programmes at various aggregation levels using Modified Causal Forests, a causal machine learning estimator. While all programmes have positive effects after the lock-in period, we find substantial heterogeneity across programmes and unemployed. Simulations show that 'black-box' rules that reassign unemployed to programmes that maximise estimated individual gains can considerably improve effectiveness: up to 20 percent more (less) time spent in (un)employment within a 30 months window. A shallow policy tree delivers a simple rule that realizes about 70 percent of this gain.</p></details> | 78 pages |

This allows researchers to better understand the underlying mechanisms at work in complex systems and make more informed decisions. In many settings, we may not fully observe all the confounders that affect both the treatment and outcome variables, complicating the estimation of causal effects. To address this problem, a growing literature in both causal inference and machine learning proposes to use Instrumental Variables (IV). This paper serves as the first effort to systematically and comprehensively introduce and discuss the IV methods and their applications in both causal inference and machine learning. First, we provide the formal definition of IVs and discuss the identification problem of IV regression methods under different assumptions. Second, we categorize the existing work on IV methods into three streams according to the focus on the proposed methods, including two-stage least squares with IVs, control function with IVs, and evaluation of IVs. For each stream, we present both the classical causal inference methods, and recent developments in the machine learning literature. Then, we introduce a variety of applications of IV methods in real-world scenarios and provide a summary of the available datasets and algorithms. Finally, we summarize the literature, discuss the open problems and suggest promising future research directions for IV methods and their applications. We also develop a toolkit of IVs methods reviewed in this survey at https://github.com/causal-machine-learning-lab/mliv.</p></details> |  |

In general, an increase in aerosol concentration results in smaller droplet sizes which leads to larger, brighter, longer-lasting clouds that reflect more sunlight and cool the Earth. The strength of the effect is however heterogeneous, meaning it depends on the surrounding environment, making ACI one of the most uncertain effects in our current climate models. In our work, we use causal machine learning to estimate ACI from satellite observations by reframing the problem as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius). We predict the causal effect of aerosol on clouds with uncertainty bounds depending on the unknown factors that may be influencing the impact of aerosol. Of the three climate models evaluated, we find that only one plausibly recreates the trend, lending more credence to its estimate cooling due to ACI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08413v2)** | 2022-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained language models are critical components of modern NLP pipelines. Yet, they suffer from spurious correlations, poor out-of-domain generalization, and biases. Inspired by recent progress in causal machine learning, in particular the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm, we propose invariant language modeling, a framework for learning invariant representations that generalize better across multiple environments. In particular, we adapt a game-theoretic formulation of IRM (IRM-games) to language models, where the invariance emerges from a specific training schedule in which all the environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion. We focus on controlled experiments to precisely demonstrate the ability of our method to (i) remove structured noise, (ii) ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting global performance, and (iii) achieve better out-of-domain generalization. These benefits come with a negligible computational overhead compared to standard training, do not require changing the local loss, and can be applied to any language model. We believe this framework is promising to help mitigate spurious correlations and biases in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at EMNLP 2022</p></details> |

To achieve the "sustainable intensification" of agriculture, transforming it from carbon emitter to carbon sink is a priority, and understanding the environmental impact of agricultural management practices is a fundamental prerequisite to that. At the same time, the global agricultural landscape is deeply heterogeneous, with differences in climate, soil, and land use inducing variations in how agricultural systems respond to farmer actions. The "personalization" of sustainable agriculture with the provision of locally adapted management advice is thus a necessary condition for the efficient uplift of green metrics, and an integral development in imminent policies. Here, we formulate personalized sustainable agriculture as a Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimation task and use Causal Machine Learning for tackling it. Leveraging climate data, land use information and employing Double Machine Learning, we estimate the heterogeneous effect of sustainable practices on the field-level Soil Organic Carbon content in Lithuania. We thus provide a data-driven perspective for targeting sustainable practices and effectively expanding the global carbon sink.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication and spotlight presentation at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |

In the decades since, much progress has been made across several research fronts in causal inference, notably including the re-weighting and matching paradigms. Focusing on the former and specifically on its intersection with machine learning and semiparametric efficiency theory, we re-examine the role of the propensity score in modern methodological developments. As Rosenbaum & Rubin (1983)'s contribution spurred a focus on the balancing property of the propensity score, we re-examine the degree to which and how this property plays a role in the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effects; moreover, we discuss a connection between the balancing property and efficient estimation in the form of score equations and propose a score test for evaluating whether an estimator achieves balance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in a forthcoming special issue of Observational Studies</p></details> |

We focus on evaluating and improving contextual treatment assignment decisions: these are personalised treatments applied to e.g. customers, each with their own contextual information, with the aim of maximising a reward. In this paper we introduce a model-agnostic framework for gathering data to evaluate and improve contextual decision making through Bayesian Experimental Design. Specifically, our method is used for the data-efficient evaluation of the regret of past treatment assignments. Unlike approaches such as A/B testing, our method avoids assigning treatments that are known to be highly sub-optimal, whilst engaging in some exploration to gather pertinent information. We achieve this by introducing an information-based design objective, which we optimise end-to-end. Our method applies to discrete and continuous treatments. Comparing our information-theoretic approach to baselines in several simulation studies demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2022 Workshop on Adaptive Experimental Design and Active Learning in the Real World. 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating individual causal/treatment effects under observed confounders, which can be controlled for and moderate the effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest. Black-box ML models adjusted for the causal setting perform generally well in this task, but they lack interpretable output identifying the main drivers of treatment heterogeneity and their functional relationship. We propose a novel deep counterfactual learning architecture for estimating individual treatment effects that can simultaneously: i) convey targeted regularization on, and produce quantify uncertainty around the quantity of interest (i.e., the Conditional Average Treatment Effect); ii) disentangle baseline prognostic and moderating effects of the covariates and output interpretable score functions describing their relationship with the outcome. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the method via a simple simulated experiment.</p></details> |  |

Considering a survey-based sample of buyers of supersaver tickets, we investigate which customer- or trip-related characteristics (including the discount rate) predict buying behavior, namely: booking a trip otherwise not realized by train, buying a first- rather than second-class ticket, or rescheduling a trip (e.g.\ away from rush hours) when being offered a supersaver ticket. Predictive machine learning suggests that customer's age, demand-related information for a specific connection (like departure time and utilization), and the discount level permit forecasting buying behavior to a certain extent. Furthermore, we use causal machine learning to assess the impact of the discount rate on rescheduling a trip, which seems relevant in the light of capacity constraints at rush hours. Assuming that (i) the discount rate is quasi-random conditional on our rich set of characteristics and (ii) the buying decision increases weakly monotonically in the discount rate, we identify the discount rate's effect among `always buyers', who would have traveled even without a discount, based on our survey that asks about customer behavior in the absence of discounts. We find that on average, increasing the discount rate by one percentage point increases the share of rescheduled trips by 0.16 percentage points among always buyers. Investigating effect heterogeneity across observables suggests that the effects are higher for leisure travelers and during peak hours when controlling several other characteristics.</p></details> |  |

Besides assessing the average impacts of different types of coupons, we also investigate the heterogeneity of causal effects across different subgroups of customers, e.g., between clients with relatively high vs. low prior purchases. Finally, we use optimal policy learning to determine (in a data-driven way) which customer groups should be targeted by the coupon campaign in order to maximize the marketing intervention's effectiveness in terms of sales. We find that only two out of the five coupon categories examined, namely coupons applicable to the product categories of drugstore items and other food, have a statistically significant positive effect on retailer sales. The assessment of group average treatment effects reveals substantial differences in the impact of coupon provision across customer groups, particularly across customer groups as defined by prior purchases at the store, with drugstore coupons being particularly effective among customers with high prior purchases and other food coupons among customers with low prior purchases. Our study provides a use case for the application of causal machine learning in business analytics to evaluate the causal impact of specific firm policies (like marketing campaigns) for decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep End-to-end Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02195v2)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference is essential for data-driven decision making across domains such as business engagement, medical treatment and policy making. However, research on causal discovery has evolved separately from inference methods, preventing straight-forward combination of methods from both fields. In this work, we develop Deep End-to-end Causal Inference (DECI), a single flow-based non-linear additive noise model that takes in observational data and can perform both causal discovery and inference, including conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. We provide a theoretical guarantee that DECI can recover the ground truth causal graph under standard causal discovery assumptions. Motivated by application impact, we extend this model to heterogeneous, mixed-type data with missing values, allowing for both continuous and discrete treatment decisions. Our results show the competitive performance of DECI when compared to relevant baselines for both causal discovery and (C)ATE estimation in over a thousand experiments on both synthetic datasets and causal machine learning benchmarks across data-types and levels of missingness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prescriptive maintenance with causal machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01562v1)** | 2022-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine maintenance is a challenging operational problem, where the goal is to plan sufficient preventive maintenance to avoid machine failures and overhauls. Maintenance is often imperfect in reality and does not make the asset as good as new. Although a variety of imperfect maintenance policies have been proposed in the literature, these rely on strong assumptions regarding the effect of maintenance on the machine's condition, assuming the effect is (1) deterministic or governed by a known probability distribution, and (2) machine-independent. This work proposes to relax both assumptions by learning the effect of maintenance conditional on a machine's characteristics from observational data on similar machines using existing methodologies for causal inference. By predicting the maintenance effect, we can estimate the number of overhauls and failures for different levels of maintenance and, consequently, optimize the preventive maintenance frequency to minimize the total estimated cost. We validate our proposed approach using real-life data on more than 4,000 maintenance contracts from an industrial partner. Empirical results show that our novel, causal approach accurately predicts the maintenance effect and results in individualized maintenance schedules that are more accurate and cost-effective than supervised or non-individualized approaches.</p></details> |  |

Beyond the inherent capabilities of adding domain knowledge into learning systems, CML provides a complete toolset for investigating how a system would react to an intervention (e.g.\ outcome given a treatment). Quantifying effects of interventions allows actionable decisions to be made whilst maintaining robustness in the presence of confounders. Here, we explore how causal inference can be incorporated into different aspects of clinical decision support (CDS) systems by using recent advances in machine learning. Throughout this paper, we use Alzheimer's disease (AD) to create examples for illustrating how CML can be advantageous in clinical scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges present in healthcare applications such as processing high-dimensional and unstructured data, generalisation to out-of-distribution samples, and temporal relationships, that despite the great effort from the research community remain to be solved. Finally, we review lines of research within causal representation learning, causal discovery and causal reasoning which offer the potential towards addressing the aforementioned challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recent developments in the field of causal machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we extract the agricultural management practices of "crop rotation" and "landscape crop diversity" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to 2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and analyze it.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in EARTHVISION 2022, in conjunction with the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2022 Conference</p></details> |

We assume access to a long-term dataset where only past treatments were administered and a short-term dataset where novel treatments have been administered. We propose a surrogate based approach where we assume that the long-term effect is channeled through a multitude of available short-term proxies. Our work combines three major recent techniques in the causal machine learning literature: surrogate indices, dynamic treatment effect estimation and double machine learning, in a unified pipeline. We show that our method is consistent and provides root-n asymptotically normal estimates under a Markovian assumption on the data and the observational policy. We use a data-set from a major corporation that includes customer investments over a three year period to create a semi-synthetic data distribution where the major qualitative properties of the real dataset are preserved. We evaluate the performance of our method and discuss practical challenges of deploying our formal methodology and how to address them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation Methods and Measures for Causal Learning Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02896v1)** | 2022-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convenient access to copious multi-faceted data has encouraged machine learning researchers to reconsider correlation-based learning and embrace the opportunity of causality-based learning, i.e., causal machine learning (causal learning). Recent years have therefore witnessed great effort in developing causal learning algorithms aiming to help AI achieve human-level intelligence. Due to the lack-of ground-truth data, one of the biggest challenges in current causal learning research is algorithm evaluations. This largely impedes the cross-pollination of AI and causal inference, and hinders the two fields to benefit from the advances of the other. To bridge from conventional causal inference (i.e., based on statistical methods) to causal learning with big data (i.e., the intersection of causal inference and machine learning), in this survey, we review commonly-used datasets, evaluation methods, and measures for causal learning using an evaluation pipeline similar to conventional machine learning. We focus on the two fundamental causal-inference tasks and causality-aware machine learning tasks. Limitations of current evaluation procedures are also discussed. We then examine popular causal inference tools/packages and conclude with primary challenges and opportunities for benchmarking causal learning algorithms in the era of big data. The survey seeks to bring to the forefront the urgency of developing publicly available benchmarks and consensus-building standards for causal learning evaluation with observational data. In doing so, we hope to broaden the discussions and facilitate collaboration to advance the innovation and application of causal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

In this work, a recently proposed brain inspired learning algorithm namely-\emph{Neurochaos Learning} (NL) is used for the classification of cause-effect from simulated data.

An increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r$_{e}$). The smaller droplet size leads to brighter, more expansive, and longer lasting clouds that reflect more incoming sunlight, thus cooling the earth. Globally, aerosol-cloud interactions cool the Earth, however the strength of the effect is heterogeneous over different meteorological regimes. Understanding how aerosol-cloud interactions evolve as a function of the local environment can help us better understand sources of error in our Earth system models, which currently fail to reproduce the observed relationships. In this work we use recent non-linear, causal machine learning methods to study the heterogeneous effects of aerosols on cloud droplet radius.</p></details> |  |
| **[Problems with information theoretic approaches to causal learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12497v1)** | 2021-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The language of information theory is favored in both causal reasoning and machine learning frameworks. But, is there a better language than this? In this study, we demonstrate the pitfalls of infotheoretic estimation using first order statistics on (short) sequences for causal learning. We recommend the use of data compression based approaches for causality testing since these make very little assumptions on data as opposed to infotheoretic measures, and are more robust to finite data length effects. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges posed in modeling the effects of conditioning process $X$ with another process $Y$ in causal machine learning. Specifically, conditioning can increase 'confusion' which can be difficult to model by classical information theory. A conscious causal agent creates new choices, decisions and meaning which poses huge challenges for AI.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Causal Decision Making and Causal Effect Estimation Are Not the Same... and Why It Matters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04103v3)** | 2021-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal decision making (CDM) based on machine learning has become a routine part of business. Businesses algorithmically target offers, incentives, and recommendations to affect consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE) using machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective: CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood by practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is different, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the use of statistical models for CDM. We draw on prior research to highlight three implications. (1) We should consider carefully the objective function of the causal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate treatment assignment rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding does not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot is that for supporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded data as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical modeling may not be necessary to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling might do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least one broad common CDM practice that seems wrong at first blush: the widespread use of non-causal models for targeting interventions. The last two implications are particularly important in practice, as acquiring (unconfounded) data on all counterfactuals can be costly and often impracticable. These observations open substantial research ground. We hope to facilitate research in this area by pointing to related articles from multiple contributing fields, including two dozen articles published the last three to four years.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Targeting in Fundraising: A Causal Machine-Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10251v3)** | 2021-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ineffective fundraising lowers the resources charities can use to provide goods. We combine a field experiment and a causal machine-learning approach to increase a charity's fundraising effectiveness. The approach optimally targets a fundraising instrument to individuals whose expected donations exceed solicitation costs. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning-based optimal targeting allows the charity to substantially increase donations net of fundraising costs relative to uniform benchmarks in which either everybody or no one receives the gift. To that end, it (a) should direct its fundraising efforts to a subset of past donors and (b) never address individuals who were previously asked but never donated. Further, we show that the benefits of machine-learning-based optimal targeting even materialize when the charity only exploits publicly available geospatial information or applies the estimated optimal targeting rule to later fundraising campaigns conducted in similar samples. We conclude that charities not engaging in optimal targeting waste significant resources.</p></details> |  |

(2020) offers an extensive study to explicate and evaluate the performance of the BCF model in different settings and provides a detailed discussion about its utility in causal inference. It is a welcomed addition to the causal machine learning literature. I will emphasize the contribution of the BCF model to the field of causal inference through discussions on two topics: 1) the difference between the PS in the BCF model and the Bayesian PS in a Bayesian updating approach, 2) an alternative exposition of the role of the PS in outcome modeling based methods for the estimation of causal effects. I will conclude with comments on avenues for future research involving BCF that will be important and much needed in the era of Big data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating heterogeneous survival treatment effect in observational data using machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07044v4)** | 2021-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effect in observational data have largely focused on continuous or binary outcomes, and have been relatively less vetted with survival outcomes. Using flexible machine learning methods in the counterfactual framework is a promising approach to address challenges due to complex individual characteristics, to which treatments need to be tailored. To evaluate the operating characteristics of recent survival machine learning methods for the estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity and inform better practice, we carry out a comprehensive simulation study presenting a wide range of settings describing confounded heterogeneous survival treatment effects and varying degrees of covariate overlap. Our results suggest that the nonparametric Bayesian Additive Regression Trees within the framework of accelerated failure time model (AFT-BART-NP) consistently yields the best performance, in terms of bias, precision and expected regret. Moreover, the credible interval estimators from AFT-BART-NP provide close to nominal frequentist coverage for the individual survival treatment effect when the covariate overlap is at least moderate. Including a non-parametrically estimated propensity score as an additional fixed covariate in the AFT-BART-NP model formulation can further improve its efficiency and frequentist coverage. Finally, we demonstrate the application of flexible causal machine learning estimators through a comprehensive case study examining the heterogeneous survival effects of two radiotherapy approaches for localized high-risk prostate cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
